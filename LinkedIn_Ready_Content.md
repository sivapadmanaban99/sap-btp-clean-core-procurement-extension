‚ö° Cloud Foundry vs Kyma for SAP BTP: Here's what I learned

After deploying my AI forecasting app, here's the breakdown:

Cloud Foundry ‚úÖ
‚Ä¢ Enterprise-grade security out of the box
‚Ä¢ Mature ecosystem & extensive documentation  
‚Ä¢ Perfect for traditional enterprise apps
‚Ä¢ Built-in monitoring and logging

Kyma ‚úÖ  
‚Ä¢ Kubernetes-native approach
‚Ä¢ Better for microservices architecture
‚Ä¢ Event-driven patterns
‚Ä¢ Modern cloud-native development

For Clean Core applications? Both work, but CF wins for enterprise readiness.

What's your deployment preference?

### Day 6 Post:
```
ü§ñ Build Process Automation just changed how I think about workflows

Instead of coding complex approval processes, I:
‚úÖ Designed workflows visually in 30 minutes
‚úÖ Connected to SAP systems with zero custom code
‚úÖ Added AI decision points with drag-and-drop
‚úÖ Deployed to production in one click

Result: 80% faster PR creation process for supply chain teams.

The no-code revolution in enterprise is real. Are you using BPA yet?

```
Great question! I'd recommend starting with:
1. SAP BTP trial account (free)
2. Complete the CAP tutorials on developers.sap.com

The learning curve is worth it - Clean Core is the future of SAP development. Happy to share more resources if helpful!

The market for Clean Core developers is incredibly hot right now! I've seen 300% increase in job postings requiring these skills.

The $4.2M savings comes from:
‚Ä¢ 35% reduction in excess inventory
‚Ä¢ 80% faster procurement processes
